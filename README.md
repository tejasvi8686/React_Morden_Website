# Gym Website - React Project

Hi everyone! 👋

I’m excited to share my new project with you: a Gym website made with React! 😍

## Overview

This project showcases a fully functional Gym website built using React, which includes 6 main pages: Home, About, Gallery, Plans, Trainers, and Contact. The website not only serves as a Gym's online presence but also demonstrates my proficiency in React development. Throughout the development process, I utilized Firebase for hosting, making it easier to deploy and manage the application. You can access the live version of the website by following this link: [Gym Website Live](https://lnkd.in/dK8FzbeP) 🚀.
